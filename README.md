# TrackYourChild
Its android application which reads sms and send it to your email id



Any new sms will be mailed to the email id which you setup on app
On Launch it will ask for email id and password (These will be your gmail id and password) and another email id on which you will receive emails. I have implemented smtp with gmail as host so your gmail id and password will be required as "from email " authentication
After setup , you will land on dashboard activity where i have given button to reset setup
After setup, you can keep app in background, and send sms to that phone on which you have installed apk, you will receive email with content of that sms and the number from which you have received that sms
